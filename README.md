# Contributing blogs to Pylenin

First of all, thanks a lot for considering to contribute an article to the Pylenin community. We all are interested to learn various aspects of Python. Needless to say, not everyone can be a master at everything. So we really appreciate your contribution to teaching us something new.

## How to contribute to Pylenin
You can contribute in 2 ways.
1. **Submit an article on your topic of interest that makes use of Python.** 

   This website is Python focused knwoledge sharing site. So currently we are not accepting articles on other languages or frameworks, unless you can make a connection between the other language/framework and Python.
   
   For example -
   1. Using React with Django
   2. Understanding CPython for debugging with examples.
   3. Gitlab CI/CD for ETL pipelines
   
2. **Improving articles written by others.**

   We don't claim to be experts here, but we want to become. Therefore we are always willing to learn additional things and accept criticism. If you feel an article on a particular topic misses out on certain facts or is conveying a wrong information, feel free to correct it. We would truly appreciate your effort.
   

## Using this repo for submitting articles.

You can see the directory structure of `my_name` folder. 
It consists of a sub-folder called `blog-name` and `author_details.json`. The `blog-name` folder consists of 3 files, `blog.md` to write your blog, a sub-folder `images` to store images for your blog and `co_authors.json` to provide info about co-authors.

Follow these steps to submit an article to Pylenin.
1) Fork this repo.
2) Copy & paste the `my-name` folder and rename it to your own name. Use camelcasing. **Dont' make any changes to the `my_name` folder.** This is the reference folder for all authors.
3) Rename the `blog-name` folder based on the name of your article you are submitting. **So every blog is a subfolder within your name folder**.
4) Now you can write your blog inside `blog.md` in **markdown** format. You can find a cheat sheet to Markdown [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
5) If you are using images(which you should), store your images in the images folder.
6) Fill up the `author_detail.json` with your information. If you have **co-authors**, there is an arrangement for mentioning their names as well in the `co_authors.json` file.
7) Make a PR !!
